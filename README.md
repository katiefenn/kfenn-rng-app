# Roman Numeral Generator App
An app for generating and parsing roman numerals.

## Getting started
The app is bundled with a development server. To use it, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.JS
- npm
- Grunt

Then run the command from the command line in the project root directory:

```
npm install
grunt server
```

Grunt should automatically open a tab in a web browser, but if this doesn't work, the website can be viewed with the URL:

[http://localhost:9001/](http://localhost:9001/)

### Testing

```
